# Party Pocket - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach** drawing inspiration from modern mobile-first social and productivity apps:
- **Primary References**: Houseparty (playful social gaming), Instagram (modern mobile UI patterns), Notion (clean productivity tools)
- **Key Principle**: Energetic playfulness meets functional clarity - the games section should feel exciting and social while productivity tools maintain clean efficiency

## Typography System

**Font Families**:
- Primary: Inter (Google Fonts) - Clean, modern, excellent mobile readability
- Accent: Poppins (Google Fonts) - Rounded, friendly for game titles and CTAs

**Type Scale**:
- Hero/Game Titles: text-4xl to text-5xl, font-bold (Poppins)
- Section Headers: text-2xl to text-3xl, font-semibold (Poppins)
- Player Names/Labels: text-lg to text-xl, font-medium (Inter)
- Body Text: text-base, font-normal (Inter)
- Captions/Metadata: text-sm, font-normal (Inter)
- Buttons: text-base to text-lg, font-semibold (Poppins)

## Layout System

**Spacing Primitives**: Use Tailwind units of **2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16** for consistent rhythm
- Tight spacing (buttons, inline elements): p-2, gap-2
- Standard spacing (cards, sections): p-4, p-6, gap-4
- Generous spacing (major sections): p-8, p-12, mt-16
- Mobile-optimized: Always use responsive spacing (p-4 md:p-8)

**Container Strategy**:
- Full viewport mobile app: All screens use h-screen with overflow management
- Safe area padding: px-4 for all content to respect mobile notches
- Bottom navigation clearance: pb-20 for content above bottom nav
- Max-width constraints: max-w-md mx-auto for content-heavy screens

**Grid System**:
- Single column default (mobile-first)
- Game elements: Circular/radial layouts for bottle spin, player arrangement
- Productivity tools: Traditional vertical stacks with clear sections

## Component Library

## Animations & Micro-interactions

**Essential Animations** (purposeful only):

- Pull-to-refresh: Loading spinner with spring physics

**Performance Note**: Keep animations to 60fps, use CSS transforms (translateX, scale) over position changes

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

**Touch Optimization**:
- Minimum tap target: 44x44px (w-11 h-11)
- Spacing between tappable elements: minimum gap-2
- Prevent accidental taps: Adequate padding around critical actions
- Swipe gestures: Clear visual affordances

**Responsive Behavior**:
- Portrait-primary orientation (lock for games)
- Small screens (320px): Reduce text scales by one step
- Large screens (768px+): Center content with max-w-md
- Keyboard handling: Scroll to input when focused

**Loading & Performance**:
- Skeleton screens for initial loads
- Instant feedback on all interactions
- Optimistic UI updates (update UI before server confirmation)
- Progressive enhancement: Core features work immediately

## Accessibility

**Touch & Interaction**:
- All interactive elements meet 44x44px minimum
- Sufficient contrast for text legibility
- Focus indicators for keyboard navigation (tab support on tablets)
- Screen reader labels on icon-only buttons

**Visual Hierarchy**:
- Clear heading structure (h1, h2, h3)
- Consistent use of font weights for importance
- Generous line-height for readability: leading-relaxed (1.625)
- Maximum text width for notes/tasks: max-w-prose

## Screen-Specific Layouts

**Home Dashboard**: 
- Hero section with app name/tagline at top
- Grid of game mode cards (2 columns on small screens)
- Utility tools below (calculator, notes quick access)
- Bottom navigation always visible

**Game Screens**:
- Full viewport immersive experience
- Back button: Fixed top-left, clear tap target
